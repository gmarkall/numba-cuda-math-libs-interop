# Demonstration of calling cuRAND functions from Numba kernels. Shim functions
# in a .cu file are used to access the cuRAND functions from Numba. This is
# based on the cuRAND device API example in:
# https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/curand/device-api-overview.html#device-api-example
#
# The result produced by this example agrees with the documentation example.
# E.g. on a particular configuration:
#
# Output from this example:                  0.4999931156635
# Output from cuRAND documentation example:  0.4999931156635
#
# Note that this example requires an installation of the CUDA toolkit 11.0 or
# later, because NVRTC will use the include files from the installed CUDA
# toolkit.
