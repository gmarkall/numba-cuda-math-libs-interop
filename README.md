# Numba CUDA Math Libraries Interoperability

Examples of the different techniques for interoperating for the CUDA Math
Libraries.

Examples:

* cuRAND: Header-only C library
* cuFFTDx: Header-only C++ library with template-based DSL
* libdevice: builtin to Numba, but need to add example / detail here
* fp16: Now builtin to Numba, but need to add example / detail here
* cuBLASLt: Need to add example in future
* ... Others likely to be added in future
